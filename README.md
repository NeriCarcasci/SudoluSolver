# SudoluSolver

## Description:
This project is a Python program that solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. The program can solve any valid Sudoku puzzle, including puzzles with multiple solutions, in a fast and efficient manner.


### What is Backtracking?
A backtracking algorithm is a brute-force algorithm that is used to solve problems by incrementally building a solution candidate and then rejecting it as soon as it is determined to be invalid. The algorithm then backtracks to the previous state and tries a different solution candidate.

In the case of a Sudoku puzzle, the backtracking algorithm works by systematically filling each empty cell with a candidate value (typically 1-9) and then checking whether the current state is valid by ensuring that the same value does not appear twice in the same row, column or sub-grid. If the current state is invalid, the algorithm backtracks to the previous state and tries a different candidate value. If there are no more candidate values to try, the algorithm backtracks even further until it finds a previous state with more candidates to try.

This process continues until the algorithm reaches a state where all cells have been filled and the Sudoku puzzle is solved, or until the algorithm exhausts all possible candidates without finding a solution. At that point, the algorithm reports that the puzzle has no solution.

In summary, a backtracking algorithm is an effective method for solving Sudoku puzzles because it systematically tries all possible solutions until a valid one is found. This method can be more efficient than other methods because it avoids duplicate computations and can quickly discard invalid solutions.
